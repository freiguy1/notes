### Notes:

Going to have to limit current with the stepper driver to 1.7A. Use the potentiometer on it to do so.  On the page for the stepper controller it describes how to do this.

Both the stepper controller and microcontroller can take voltage as high as 36V. This means I could use a laptop charger for power.  I wouldn't need to have a voltage regulator at all, which is special.
