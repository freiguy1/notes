I just wanted to write a couple notes on the cabinets I'm making for Tim so I don't forget certain things.

The 3 front cross braces are 2" tall.  There's one at the top, one at the bottom, then one starts 5" down from the bottom of the top. Drawer goes in between.

I used 3 rear cross braces too made from 3/4" plywood. They were also 2" tall except for the bottom which was tall enough to make the bottom set even.

The drawer and cabinet door overhang the cabinet sides by 1/2" leaving 1/4" of sides revealed.
