General notes for making a recumbent tadpole trike with a wooden frame. The [base plan](http://www.atomiczombie.com/Warrior%20Recumbent%20Tadpole%20Racing%20Trike.aspx) comes from
Atomic Zombie plans and I'll be adapting it to use wood instead of all metal. Several of the parts
will still be metal which will come from recycled bicycles and custom made pieces.
