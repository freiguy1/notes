# Strawberry Mint Deliciousness

### Ingredients
- 1 quart strawberries
- a few sprigs of mint
- a tablespoon or so of honey (depending on your desired sweetness level)
- lime wedges
- club soda
- vodka or gin (if desired)

Blend the strawberries, mint leaves, and honey in a blender until smooth.  When ready to serve, pour the strawberry puree over ice (I filled the glass about halfway), add an ounce or two of liquor, top with club soda, drop in a squeezed wedge or two of lime, stir.
