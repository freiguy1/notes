# Sourdough Bread

## The Bread

### Ingredients
- 3 cups flour (I use a mixture of wheat and bread flour--typically 2 cups wheat, 1 cup bread)

## The Starter

### Ingredients
- 1/4 cup flour (I prefer white bread flour)
- 1/4 cup water (I prefer filtered)

Put the flour and water in a glass jar or container and whisk them together briskly, mixing air into the mixture.  Cover the jar with lid, piece of cloth, or paper towel and set in a warmish place in your kitchen.  Let is rest for 12 hours or so.

After 12 hours, feed the starter by adding another 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of water.  Whisk together again, cover, and let rest for another 12 hours.  Continue this process for 3-5 days, until bubbles are regularly forming and the mixture has a pungent, sour smell.  At this point, you can start using the starter.  You can also switch to feeding the starter once per day.  If you find that you have sourdough overflowing from your jar (a very real and literal possibility), you can move it to a larger container, give some away, or you can slow the process down by slowing your starter in the fridge and just feeding it once per week.  If you store it in the fridge, just take it out 12 hours or so before you want to use it, feed it, and let it rest.  This will reactivate the yeast.  

When you are first getting your starter going, you may have a clear liquid that develops on the top of your mixture.  This is alcohol from the fermentation process.  If this happens, just decrease the amount of water that you add when you feed it and it should solve the problem.  Also, remember that it may take up to a couple of months for the yeast in your starter to be strong enough to really cause the dough to rise.
