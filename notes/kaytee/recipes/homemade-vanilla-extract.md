# Homemade Vanilla Extract

### Ingredients
- a few vanilla bean skins (you can scrape the little beans/specks out of them first and use that in another recipe, like pudding, or if you're impatient like me, you can just use the whole thing) Can buy [online](http://www.olivenation.com/Bourbon-Madagascar-Vanilla-Beans-P84.aspx)
- cheap vodka (enough to cover the beans)
- a jar (I use glass for everything.  A 1/2 pint mason works well for this.)

Cut up the beans so that they fit nicely into the bottom of your jar.  Cover with vodka.  Tightly cover and store in a dark place for at least 3 weeks (the longer the better).  Shake/turn the jar every few days so that the beans evenly infuse into the vodka.  When your extract reaches a nice carmel color and smells like vanilla, it's ready!!  Strain out the vanilla bean particles and pour your finished product into a container to be used and enjoyed!  I used an old essential oil bottle for mine and added a cute label.  It's not a science...so play around with it!  You can keep adding beans and vodka to the mix, as you use it, or start over each time.
