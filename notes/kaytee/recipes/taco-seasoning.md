# Taco Seasoning

### Ingredients
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 2 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander 
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- hot spices, if you so desire, such as red pepper flakes, Tabasco, Siracha, jalape√±os, chilies, etc.

This recipe is for a one pound batch of taco meat or lentils.  I always cook my meat or lentils with a chopped onion and some garlic to add flavor.  I also never really measure the proportions listed above, I just kind of guess.  Make it your own, experiment with the mixture.  Have fun with it!
