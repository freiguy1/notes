# Basil Pesto

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup walnuts
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 cups packed fresh basil leaves
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice (fresh or bottled, but fresh is preferred)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Add the walnuts and olive oil to a blender or food processor and blend until mostly smooth.  Add the garlic and blend until smooth.  Add the basil leaves, small amounts may be necessary depending on your blender/food processor.  Add the lemon juice and salt.  Processor until it reaches your preferred consistency.  I tend to leave mine a bit chunky.  Fill an ice cube tray with the pesto.  One batch should fill one ice cube tray (in the picture above I reserved a bit for my dinner that night so it didn't quite fill a tray).  Freeze until solid and then transfer into a freezer container or bag.  Keep in your freezer for up to a year and use as you need it!
