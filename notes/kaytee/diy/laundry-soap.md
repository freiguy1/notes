# Laundry Soap

2 cups grated soap (I make my own, but I used to use a mixture of Fels-Naptha and Ivory.  Fels-Naptha is a hard laundry bar and Ivory is cheap and soft, which makes it easy to grate.  Fels-Naptha can be found in the laundry isle at a lot of the big stores like Target, Walmart, Cub, etc.)

1 cup washing soda (This is an all-natural product--Sodium Carbonate, but is different from baking soda--Sodium Bicarbonate.  You should be able to find it in the laundry isle.  Arm & Hammer is the most common brand.)

1 cup borax (This is an all-natural detergent that can also be found in the laundry isle.  Some have objections as to whether it's safe or not.  This blog post pulls together a lot of what the experts have to say about that.  20 Mule Team is a good brand.)

I grate my soap using a cheese grater.  Since it's soap, and I make my own, I use my cheese grater from the kitchen.  I figure it just makes it cleaner.  Mix all of the ingredients together until the grated soap breaks down a bit and you have a powder-like consistency.  Store in an airtight container.

Use 2 tbs for a full load.  I use white vinegar as a fabric softener.  I pour about a 1/4 cup into my Downy Ball and throw it into the load.  (The fabric softener spot on your washer will also work, but your washer may consistently smell like vinegar).  

I find that the detergent works great!  Whenever I wash whites or really dirty things, I pour a little extra borax in the load and let them soak a bit.  They brighten right up!
