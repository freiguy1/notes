On St Patty's day, I really enjoy a cooked corn beef with cabbage and potatoes.  However, since I don't make it that often, I thought I'd take some notes.

#### Ingredients

1. One corn beef (which should come w/ a seasoning packet). This year was 1.7 lb.
2. One head of cabbage
3. 8 baby red potatoes
4. Like 8 Carrots

#### Directions

1. Chop poatoes up into bite size pieces.
2. Put thawed beef in 5 qt crock pot.
3. Fill with a few cups of water.
4. After 1 hour on high, put carrots in, reduce heat to low.
5. After 1 hour, put potatoes in.
6. After 1 hour, put cabbage in.
7. Wait 2-3 more hours.



That's what I'm doing this year (2015).  If it's terrible, I'll delete this note.

I tweaked this recipe a bit since we weren't completely pleased with the outcome.
