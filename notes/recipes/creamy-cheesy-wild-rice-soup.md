## Creamy, Cheesy Wild Rice Soup

### Developed by Cassie Stayton

- 3/4 cup wild rice
- 1 med/large onion
- 3 med cloves of garlic
- 30 oz chicken broth
- 2 slices of uncooked bacon
- Dash of pepper

Simmer above for about 60 minutes

Fry 6 pieces of bacon until crisp
When rice mixture is done, add heavy whipping cream, velveeta cheese, cheddar cheese, and colby cheese, to desire flavor.

Hint: You can cut up 2 or 3 chicken breasts, into cubes, and add to rice mixture when rice is nearly cooked.  Just so the chicken has time to cook.  10 minutes?

I'm going to attempt to find a good combination of the above cream/cheesy ingredients. Maybe I'll start w/ a half cup each (shredding the colby and cheddar cheese?)

### My Version:

Ingredients:

- 3/4 cup wild rice
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 32 oz chicken broth
- 8 slices bacon
- dash of pepper
- 3 oz colby (I think), cubed/sliced
- 3 oz cheddar (I think), cubed/sliced
- Half small container of velveeta, cubed/sliced
- 1 super large or 2 chicken breasts, cubed
- 1 smallest container heavy whipping cream
- 1/2c water

Steps:

1. Simmer wild rice, garlic, onion, wild rice, broth, pepper and 2 slices of uncooked bacon for 60 min covered.
2. Fry rest of bacon until crisp (a bit longer than how I like breakfast bacon.
3. When simmering is 10 min from completion, put in cubed chicken breast.
4. When simmering complete, add cheeses, heavy whipping cream, water and crumbled cooked bacon.
5. Remove uncooked bacon, its job is complete.
6. Keep heating until all cheeses are melted.
7. ...
8. Profit.
