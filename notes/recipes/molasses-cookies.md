# Molasses Cookies

Originally from [this website](https://www.food.com/recipe/memos-molasses-cookies-470290). Apparently they come from an old school Brer Rabbit Molasses sticker.

## Ingredients
- 3/4c shortening
- 3/4c sugar plus maybe a T extra
- 1/4c molasses
- 1 large egg
- 2c flour
- 2t baking soda
- 1/2t clove
- 1/2t ginger
- 1t cinnamon
- 1/2t salt

## Directions
1. Melt shortening. Cool so as not to cook egg.
2. Add sugar, molasses and eg to melted shortening. Mix well.
3. Sift dry ingredients into a different bowl then mix them well.
4. Add paste ingredients to dry ingredients.
5. Chill thoroughly (for at least a few hours; I threw in the chest freezer for 2h and that seems fine).
6. Form into 1" balls, roll in granulated sugar and place on greased cookie sheet 2-3 inches apart.
7. Bake at 375 for 10-12 minutes. Cookies should be light, pillowy and soft. Not dark and crispy. Look for the tops to fissure a bit.
8. Cool on drying rack.
9. Try not to eat too many in one setting
