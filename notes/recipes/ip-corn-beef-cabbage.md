This is a recipe for the Instant Pot.

## Ingredients

- 4 lb corned beef
- Medium bag of carrots
- 8 small/4 medium or large potatoes
- 1 cabbage

## Instructions

- Put corned beef and juices in IP and almost cover it with water
- Sprinkle seasoning packet over
- Meat setting for 90 minutes & quick release steam
- 15 min before meat is done, peel carrots, wash and cut potatoes into 1 1/2" pieces, and cut cabbage into rubix cube size pieces (or smaller)
- When meat is done, quick release, brush seasonings off meat back into liquid - meat doesn't need them anymore
- Place meat on baking sheet and quickly cover w/ aluminum foil & place in oven or microwave to keep warm
- Place all veggies in liquid from cooking meat
- Manual setting for 4 minutes, quick release right away (getting closer!)
    - 4 min was still a little soft, for me, but I think 3 is hard. Maybe 3 minutes with a couple minutes of natural release
- Right before veggies done, take out meat, slice against the grain and serve with veggies!
