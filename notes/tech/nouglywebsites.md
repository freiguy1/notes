## Let your text breathe

- text-box width: 400 - 800px or 60-100 characters/line
- line-height: 1.4
- padding between text-boxes: at least 15px in any direction

## Words: make speech visual

- make your text legible
    - contrast: don't put yellow texxt on a white background
    - size: minimum 16px depending on font
    - [webaim.org](https://webaim.org) has recommendations for text/background colors
- make your text scannable
    - highlight key content
    - subheads with lowercase and uppercase letters
    - bulleted lists
- keep the decoration to a minimum
    - limit number of typefaces/fonts (2 or 3)
    - limit colors (3-5, including grays)
    - use more complex fonts for headers, more basic sans-serif for text
        - proven san-serif easier to read (georgia is a serif that is easyish)
        - #424242 color used for text color (avoid pure black)
- make visitors learn one visual pattern and stick to it
- don't be afraid of whitespace. We won't run out of space

## Images: use appropriately

- Icons
    - 99% of the time, should be accompanied by a label
    - Work best in navigation or menu (like a list of characteristics)
    - Avoid icons with conflicting meanings
- Photos and graphics
    - Banner blindness - the top rectangle gets skipped naturally because we expect it to be an ad
    - integrate with content (not on top/sides because people are skipping them)
    - be informative and/or relative
        - not just pure decoration - something that adds to content
        - not stock images

## Design: think logically

- User Patterns
    - Alternate between small, medium and wide
    - Quality trumps originality  (in most cases)
    - Find something that works and use it as a model
- Progressive disclosure
    - F-shape reading pattern
    - Top to bottom - important to less important
    - Above the fold
    - Avoid putting key content in traditional ad areas
    - Everything is available to get to somehow, but most important data is shown first.
    - Put everything there, just not on the same page.
- Be consistent
    - Links, buttons, tables, alert messages, header font/sizes, forms
    - links should be obvious
- Functionality is a part od esign
    - It doesn' tmatter if it looks good and is easy to use if it doesn't work
    - back end impacts front-end
