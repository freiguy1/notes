Dad, Mom, Andrew, Jess, Kaytee and I took a trip up to the Lake of the Woods, Minnesota.  We stayed on the [Ballard's Fishing Resort](http://www.ballardsresort.com/) where we took two charter boat trips out catching walleye and sauger. 

We took the trip in the Nissan Titan, which was quite comfortable despite us packing it quite full. However after a very long ride, the resort was still a very welcoming sight.  After checking in, we headed to our room, which was nice; it had a kitchen with fridge, stove and sink, 2 or 3 bedrooms, and a living room.  

Fishing started the next morning. To get to the fishing spot, our captain drove us about an hour across the lake!  This was quite a distance, but it wasn't terrible, as long as you were prepared... Throughout my life I've learned something interesting about myself. Standing on surfaces which aren't part of or fastened to the earth makes me sick - very sick.  Needless to say, I made sure to keep my body supplied with Dramamine throughout the next few days. We caught many fish and had a blast. Sometimes we used the trolling motor and let the lures drag behind. Other times we would let the boat stay still and after casting, let the lure drop to near the bottom before reeling in.  

Unfortunately I wasn't the only one who had trouble with motion sickness.  Jess had a rough time on the second day after taking a trip to the bottom of the boat.  That day we took a lunch break on an island which was fun to explore.  Here are some pictures from that trip.
