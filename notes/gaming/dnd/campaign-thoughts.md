The story starts in Neverwinter. Somehow the adventurers find themselves needing to head south to help out someone.  

### Inn in Neverwinter

- Name: Neverwinter Nights
    - Large elegant inn, nicer than most you've seen.
    - The modern design with huge wooden columns and a timber skeleton is unusual.
    - The timbers jut straight out exterior walls in a decorative way.
- Innkeep: Jarish Akka
    - Medium height human.
    - Bronzed skin, like he spends more time in the sun than a normal innkeep.
    - Very well cut with sharp features.
    - Dark hair, well trimmed beard.
    - Decent looking on the avg inkeeper scale.
    - Deep voice. 


In talking to the Jarish, it's revealed that travel by boat is the fastest form of transportation there. He said we could probably find a ride the next morning at the Neverwinter Harbor if we get up before the transport ships depart.

Also Jarish often sails with a few fellow sailing friends. He used to sail with a high elf Minithel, but hasn't seen or heard from him since the *accident*. Rumor is he made it back with his life but nothing else.As far as Jarish knows, on a solo trip, his high elf friend had a terrible encounter with some pirates a few hour's sail south of Neverwinter. Jarish knows the location of Minithel's home.

### Minithel

- District: Blue Peak
    - One of the higher elevated districts.
    - The hike there actually takes some effort.
    - After seeing the houses of this district, the adventurers get the sense that Jarish and Minithel are members of the higher part of society.
    - Rich large houses with large windows which have sweeping views over the city and ocean.
- Minithel's house: Exterior
    - Not quite as large as those next to it.
    - Just as elegant with a design that somehow incorporates designs from sailboats.
    - Two large bushes surround the start of the walkway to the house.
        - Shaped as anchors
        - Haven't been trimmed in a while
    -  If anyone rolls perception, and gets higher than 15, they see a broken window near the top of the house and an empty alchohol bottle in the small yard.

Knock and after a while a disheveled elf shows up at the door. 

- Minithel
    - Average tall height for a high elf.
    - General hygene and personal care was as unkempt as the anchor bushes at the base of the footpath.
    - Slight scar which starts near his temple and disappears under his hairline running back toward the top of his ear.
    - Distrustful and a bit scared.
    -
