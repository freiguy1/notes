Night of third day run into farmer getting attacked by 7 jackals: Cran Hasbrown

- Brownie
- Wife: Sherith
- Daughter was seeing a man (Skrag) who joined cult called **Disaerdic Doc'than**
- Being attacked for 24h, wife got bit and is severely injured.

Head toward a bluff hunting Skrag for farmer Brownie. We come to a stream with a boulder next to it. there are trees/bushes around it as well. There are 3 wolves.

Keep going, find logging trail and take it. We come to a river w/ a bridge, boulder, cut down logs, and briar patch.  Trees scattered through the area. We fought and killed two spiders near the bridge. One was sleeping and we shot simultaneously at it!


After killing the spiders, they kept going. They sneakily spot a black bear and pony - Graphin's pony Alabaster.

Kept going and fought a bear and a posessed pony. Killed the bear and knocked out the pony. The pony was not possessed after it came to. We tied it to a tree. 

Kept going and came upon a hill which had a 30ft cliff on one side. In the middle of the cliff was a hole. They climbed to the top of the hill and Trim repelled Whoonakoo down to look inside. Whoonakoo then attempted deception to get Skrag out.  Skrag didn't believe him. 

(skipping some stuff)

Skrag and panther fight ends in favor of Whoon and Trim. They tie Skrag up. The next morning Skrag admits there's a bigger cave under the hill. W & T can't find the entrance and decide to head back to Brownie w/ pony and Skrag.

...

Kalin Firedrog is  Skrag's dad. Found him and he was fine w/ Skrag going to jail. 

Acquired a dog which Whoon names Schnarf.  Border collie with shaggy hair and skinny.

Approach caravan w/ 2 wagons and some horses. Leader: Caulderin Rombar. Also Hiron Grioff, Del Hammerstriker, Gade and Derrik (brothers). Groups join and Whoonakoo proceeds to tell them the story with a dazzling performance. 

That night fire, dance, music, and sleep!

As we near waterdeep we see archers, mages, and fighters with Waterdeep crest on their armor. We approach a farm on our left and a wooded hill in front of us. 8 Skeletons step out of the trees by the hill after Trim mentions he thought he saw something move in the thicket.  Horses go berzerk, take off breaking both wagons.
